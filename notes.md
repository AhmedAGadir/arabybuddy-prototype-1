Understood, you're looking for an approach where the data fetching function directly returns streamed data which can be consumed on demand (such as on a button click). Given this requirement, we'll adjust the setup to meet your needs.

### Revised Setup Using Async Generator

This setup involves an async generator function that you can call to receive streamed data incrementally. We'll make this function available through a custom hook, and you can invoke this generator each time a button is clicked in your component.

### 1. Define an Async Generator in the Hook

This generator will handle fetching the stream and yielding data as it comes in.

```javascript
async function* fetchDataStream(url) {
	const response = await fetch(url);
	const reader = response.body.getReader();

	let previousValue = "";
	while (true) {
		const { done, value } = await reader.read();
		if (done) break;
		const chunkText = new TextDecoder().decode(value, { stream: true });
		previousValue += chunkText;

		// Check for complete JSON object
		try {
			const completeData = JSON.parse(previousValue);
			yield completeData;
			previousValue = ""; // Reset buffer after yielding
		} catch (e) {
			// Continue buffering if JSON is not complete
			continue;
		}
	}
}

function useStreamData() {
	const streamData = async (url) => {
		return fetchDataStream(url);
	};

	return { streamData };
}
```

### 2. Use the Generator in a Component

This component includes a button to start the stream, and it updates its state as data comes in.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useCallback } from "react";
import { useStreamData } from "./useStreamData"; // Assume useStreamData is imported from a file

function MyComponent({ url }) {
	const { streamData } = useStreamData();
	const [streamResult, setStreamResult] = useState("");

	const handleStream = useCallback(async () => {
		const stream = await streamData(url);
		let result = "";

		for await (const data of stream) {
			result += JSON.stringify(data) + "\n"; // Concatenate each piece of data into a string
			setStreamResult(result); // Update state on each iteration
		}
	}, [url, streamData]);

	return (
		<div>
			<h1>Streamed Data</h1>
			<button onClick={handleStream}>Start Streaming</button>
			<pre>{streamResult}</pre>
		</div>
	);
}

export default MyComponent;
```

### Explanation

- **Async Generator**: The generator `fetchDataStream` yields data as soon as a complete JSON object is parsed. This approach assumes that data is being sent in chunks that may need to be buffered until they can form a complete JSON object.
- **React Component**: `MyComponent` uses a button to initiate the streaming. The state updates occur every time a new piece of complete data is yielded by the generator, and it appends this data to a string which is then displayed.

### Considerations

- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling should be added, particularly around the fetch operation and stream reading.
- **Performance**: Keep in mind that constantly updating state with large strings can become inefficient. Depending on the size and frequency of the incoming data, you may need to consider optimizing how data is handled and displayed.
- **Use Cases**: This approach is best suited for scenarios where data is expected in a reasonably human-readable frequency. High-frequency data might need a different handling strategy to avoid performance bottlenecks.

This setup should provide a more fitting solution to your requirement of streaming data on demand without relying on traditional stateful or event-based approaches beyond the necessary React state updates to reflect changes in the UI.
